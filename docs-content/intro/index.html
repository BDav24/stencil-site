<h1 id="stencil-a-compiler-for-web-components">Stencil: A Compiler for Web Components</h1>
<p>Stencil is a build tool for generating vanilla Web Components. It combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a straight-forward, compile-time tool.</p>
<p>Stencil takes advantage of</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript</li>
<li>JSX</li>
<li>Async rendering</li>
<li>V-DOM</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in place, Stencil generates a Web Component that follows web standards and no particular framework.</p>
<p>Since Stencil generates standards compliant, they can work with many popular frameworks right out of the box, and can even be used without a framework. Stencil also enables a number of key capabilities on top of Web Components, in particular Server Side Rendering (SSR) without the need to run a headless browser, pre-rendering, and objects-as-properties (instead of just strings).</p>
